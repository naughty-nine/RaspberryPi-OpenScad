# Raspberry-Pi 2B model for OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD model for Raspberry Pis 2 Model B.
Should be compatible with any version 1 or 2 (not tested).

Useful for documentation or - as the intended purpose - 3D printing models.

The model can be parametrized so that it provides cutout stencils for all outgoing connectors so you can build cases, mounts etc for it (see documentation in `rpi-modules.scad`).

### Known Issues:
The location of the LEDs, GPIO connector and micro-SD card reader are slightly off.
