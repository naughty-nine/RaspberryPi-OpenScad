# Raspberry-Pi 2B and 4 models for OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD model for Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi 2 Model B (should be compatible with any version 1 or 2 (not tested)).

Useful for documentation or - as the intended purpose - 3D printing models.

The model can be parametrized so that it provides cutout stencils for all outgoing connectors so you can build cases, mounts etc for it (see documentation in `rpi-modules.scad`).

#### Known Issues:
The location of the micro-SD card reader is slightly off.
